# Intro to Python: 5-Part Workshop Series


This set of 5 workshops is an introduction to Python programming, with a focus on skills that would be relevant to students and researchers who are working with data, particularly tabular data.

These workshops can count towards the [Canadian Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://ccdhhn.ca/).

Participants need to sign up for each workshop individually.
It is not necessary to sign up for the first workshop in order to do the second (and so on), but note that each workshop will build on the topics covered in previous workshops in this series.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will understand:
1. The basics of Python syntax, variables, and data types.
2. How to work with tabular data in Python, including reading, manipulating, and visualizing data.
3. How to automate tasks in Python, including working with multiple files.
4. How to use logic and modularity to make Python code flexible and reusable.
5. Good habits for programming for research in Python, including handling errors, debugging, and writing reliable code.
