# 4.1 Making Decisions with Conditional Statements

## Questions

- How can my programs do different things based on data values?

---------------------

In our last lesson, we discovered something suspicious was going on
in our exhibit-visit data by drawing some plots.
How can we use Python to automatically recognize the different features we saw,
and take a different action for each? In this lesson, we'll learn how to write code that
runs only when certain conditions are true.

## Conditionals

We can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with an `if` statement:

<!-- ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

The following example will lead to a syntax error in the Python prompt, as it seems to expect exactly one top-level statement per invocation.
Removing `print('done')` from the example will fix the problem.

IPython executes the example from a single prompt without throwing an error.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: -->

```python
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
print('done')
```

```output
not greater
done
```

The second line of this code uses the keyword `if` to tell Python that we want to make a choice.
If the test that follows the `if` statement is true,
the body of the `if`
(i.e., the set of lines indented underneath it) is executed, and "greater" is printed.
If the test is false,
the body of the `else` is executed instead, and "not greater" is printed.
Only one or the other is ever executed before continuing on with program execution to print "done":

![A flowchart diagram of the if-else construct that tests if variable num is greater than 100](fig/4.1_python-flowchart-conditional.png)

Conditional statements don't have to include an `else`.
If there isn't one,
Python simply does nothing if the test is false:

```python
num = 53
print('before conditional...')
if num > 100:
    print(num, 'is greater than 100')
print('...after conditional')
```

```output
before conditional...
...after conditional
```

We can also chain several tests together using `elif`,
which is short for "else if".
The following Python code uses `elif` to print the sign of a number.

```python
num = -3

if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is positive')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is negative')
```

```output
-3 is negative
```

Note that to test for equality we use a double equals sign `==`
rather than a single equals sign `=` which is used to assign values.

## Comparing in Python

Along with the `>` and `==` operators we have already used for comparing values in our
conditionals, there are a few more options to know about:

- `>`: greater than
- `<`: less than
- `==`: equal to
- `!=`: does not equal
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `<=`: less than or equal to
  
-------------------

We can also combine tests using `and` and `or`.
`and` is only true if both parts are true:

```python
if (1 > 0) and (-1 >= 0):
    print('both parts are true')
else:
    print('at least one part is false')
```

```output
at least one part is false
```

while `or` is true if at least one part is true:

```python
if (1 < 0) or (1 >= 0):
    print('at least one test is true')
```

```output
at least one test is true
```

## `True` and `False`

`True` and `False` are special words in Python called `booleans`,
which represent truth values. A statement such as `1 < 0` returns
the value `False`, while `-1 < 0` returns the value `True`.

------------------

## Looking at our data

Let's return to our dataset of museum visits.
We're going to focus on three files:

```output
exhibit-visits_city-7_varied-peak.csv
exhibit-visits_city-8_varied-peak.csv
exhibit-visits_city-9_varied-peak.csv
```

Each file is for a different city, and contains a table with 
- 8 museums (rows)
- 40 days (columns)

Let us load the data for the for city 7.

```python
import numpy

data = numpy.loadtxt(fname="exhibit-visits_city-7_varied-peak.csv", delimiter=",")
print("The shape of our data is", data.shape)
```

```output
The shape of our data is (8, 40)
```

In these cities, the museums launched their mid-exhibit advertising campaigns on different days, and the maximum number of daily visitors occurred after they launched these campaigns.

Say we want to find out whether the maximum number of visits occurred before or after the end of week 3. This is day 20 if we begin counting at 1, or day 19 if we begin counting at 0 (like Python).

```python
daily_total = numpy.sum(data, axis=0)
end_week_3 = 19

if numpy.argmax(daily_total) > end_week_3:
    print("The max number of visitors occured after week 3")
else:
    print("The max number of visitors occured in or before week 3")
```

```output
The max number of visitors occured after week 3
```

Now let's see whether city 7 and city 8 were the most busy on the same day. 

```python
data_city7 = numpy.loadtxt(fname="exhibit-visits_city-7_varied-peak.csv", delimiter=",")
data_city8 = numpy.loadtxt(fname="exhibit-visits_city-8_varied-peak.csv", delimiter=",")

daily_total_city7 = numpy.sum(data_city7, axis=0)
daily_total_city8 = numpy.sum(data_city8, axis=0)

if numpy.argmax(daily_total_city7) == numpy.argmax(daily_total_city8):
    print("Cities 7 and 8 were the most busy on the same day")
else:
    print("Cities 7 and 8 were the most busy on different days")
```

Now let's try something more complicated. Let's load the data for cities 7-9 and for each city, display which week contained their most-busy day.

One way to do this is to make a dictionary that defines which days are in which weeks, and then use conditional statements to see which range of days contains the most-busy day

```python
import glob

file_paths = sorted(glob.glob("exhibit-visits_city-*_varied-peak.csv"))

days_in_weeks = {
    "week 3": range(14, 21),
    "week 4": range(21, 28),
    "week 5": range(28, 35),
}

i_city_no = len("exhibit-visits_city-")
for file_path in file_paths:
    city_number = int(file_path[i_city_no : i_city_no + 1])
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file_path, delimiter=",")
    daily_total = numpy.sum(data, axis=0)
    most_busy_day = numpy.argmax(daily_total)

    for week_name, days_in_week in days_in_weeks.items():
        if most_busy_day in days_in_week:
            print(f"City {city_number} had their top day in {week_name}")
```

```output
City 7 had their top day in week 4
City 8 had their top day in week 5
City 9 had their top day in week 4
```

This illustrates the use of conditional statements in nested loops. But there's an easier way to accomplish this task

```python
import glob

file_paths = sorted(glob.glob("exhibit-visits_city-*_varied-peak.csv"))

i_city_no = len("exhibit-visits_city-")
for file_path in file_paths:
    city_number = int(file_path[i_city_no : i_city_no + 1])
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file_path, delimiter=",")
    daily_total = numpy.sum(data, axis=0)
    most_busy_day = numpy.argmax(daily_total)
    week_number = (most_busy_day // 7) + 1

    print(f"City {city_number} had their top day in week {week_number}")
```

```output
City 7 had their top day in week 4
City 8 had their top day in week 5
City 9 had their top day in week 4
```

## Challenge: How Many Paths?

Consider this code:

```python
if 4 > 5:
    print('A')
elif 4 == 5:
    print('B')
elif 4 < 5:
    print('C')
```

Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code?
Why did you pick this answer?

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. B and C

### Solution

C gets printed because the first two conditions, `4 > 5` and `4 == 5`, are not true,
but `4 < 5` is true.
In this case only one of these conditions can be true for at a time, but in other
scenarios multiple `elif` conditions could be met. In these scenarios only the action
associated with the first true `elif` condition will occur, starting from the top of the
conditional section.
![A flowchart diagram of a conditional section with multiple elif conditions and some possible outcomes.](fig/4.1_python-else-if.png)
This contrasts with the case of multiple `if` statements, where every action can occur
as long as their condition is met.
![A flowchart diagram of a conditional section with multiple if statements and some possible outcomes.](fig/4.1_python-multi-if.png)


## Challenge: What Is Truth?

`True` and `False` booleans are not the only values in Python that are true and false.
In fact, *any* value can be used in an `if` or `elif`.
After reading and running the code below,
explain what the rule is for which values are considered true and which are considered false.

```python
if '':
    print('empty string is true')
if 'word':
    print('word is true')
if []:
    print('empty list is true')
if [1, 2, 3]:
    print('non-empty list is true')
if 0:
    print('zero is true')
if 1:
    print('one is true')
```

## zzzz Challenge: That's Not Not What I Meant

Sometimes it is useful to check whether some condition is not true.
The Boolean operator `not` can do this explicitly.
After reading and running the code below,
write some `if` statements that use `not` to test the rule
that you formulated in the previous challenge.

```python
if not '':
    print('empty string is not true')
if not 'word':
    print('word is not true')
if not not True:
    print('not not True is true')
```


## Challenge: Close Enough

Write some conditions that print `True` if the variable `a` is within 10% of the variable `b`
and `False` otherwise.
Compare your implementation with your partner's:
do you get the same answer for all possible pairs of numbers?

### Hint

There is a [built-in function `abs`][abs-function] that returns the absolute value of
a number:

```python
print(abs(-12))
```

```output
12
```

### Solution 1

```python
a = 5
b = 5.1

if abs(a - b) <= 0.1 * abs(b):
    print('True')
else:
    print('False')
```

### Solution 2

```python
print(abs(a - b) <= 0.1 * abs(b))
```

This works because the Booleans `True` and `False`
have string representations which can be printed.

<!-- ## xxxx Challenge: In-Place Operators

Python (and most other languages in the C family) provides
[in-place operators](../learners/reference.md#in-place-operators)
that work like this:

```python
x = 1  # original value
x += 1 # add one to x, assigning result back to x
x *= 3 # multiply x by 3
print(x)
```

```output
6
```

Write some code that sums the positive and negative numbers in a list separately,
using in-place operators.
Do you think the result is more or less readable
than writing the same without in-place operators?

### Solution

```python
positive_sum = 0
negative_sum = 0
test_list = [3, 4, 6, 1, -1, -5, 0, 7, -8]
for num in test_list:
    if num > 0:
        positive_sum += num
    elif num == 0:
        pass
    else:
        negative_sum += num
print(positive_sum, negative_sum)
```

Here `pass` means "don't do anything".
In this particular case, it's not actually needed, since if `num == 0` neither
sum needs to change, but it illustrates the use of `elif` and `pass`. -->


## Challenge: Sorting a List Into Buckets

We'd like to break our list of files into three lists called `city_files`, `yearly_files`, and `other_files`,
respectively.

Add code to the template below to do this. Note that the string method
[`startswith`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith)
returns `True` if and only if the string it is called on starts with the string
passed as an argument, that is:

```python
'String'.startswith('Str')
```

```output
True
```

But

```python
'String'.startswith('str')
```

```output
False
```

Use the following Python code as your starting point:

```python
filenames = [
    "exhibit-visity_city-3.csv",
    "exhibit-visity_city-4.csv",
    "exhibit-visity_year-1_city-1.csv",
    "exhibit-visity_year-2_city-1.csv",
    "exhibit-visity_city-2.csv",
    "sandbox.py",
]
city_files = []
yearly_files = []
other_files = []
```

Your solution should:

1. loop over the names of the files
2. figure out which group each filename belongs in
3. append the filename to that list

In the end the three lists should be:


```python
city_files: ['exhibit-visity_city-3.csv', 'exhibit-visity_city-4.csv', 'exhibit-visity_city-2.csv']
yearly_files: ['exhibit-visity_year-1_city-1.csv', 'exhibit-visity_year-2_city-1.csv']
other_files: ['sandbox.py']
```

### Solution

```python
for filename in filenames:
    if filename.startswith("exhibit-visity_city"):
        city_files.append(filename)
    elif filename.startswith("exhibit-visity_year"):
        yearly_files.append(filename)
    else:
        other_files.append(filename)

print("city_files:", city_files)
print("yearly_files:", yearly_files)
print("other_files:", other_files)
```

## Challenge: Counting Vowels

1. Write a loop that counts the number of vowels in a character string.
2. Test it on a few individual words and full sentences.
3. Once you are done, compare your solution to your neighbor's.
  Did you make the same decisions about how to handle the letter 'y'
  (which some people think is a vowel, and some do not)?

### Solution

```python
vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
sentence = 'Mary had a little lamb.'
count = 0
for char in sentence:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1

print('The number of vowels in this string is ' + str(count))
```

## Key points

- Use `if condition` to start a conditional statement, `elif condition` to provide additional tests, and `else` to provide a default.
- The bodies of the branches of conditional statements must be indented.
- Use `==` to test for equality.
- `X and Y` is only true if both `X` and `Y` are true.
- `X or Y` is true if either `X` or `Y`, or both, are true.
- Zero, the empty string, and the empty list are considered false; all other numbers, strings, and lists are considered true.
- `True` and `False` represent truth values.
