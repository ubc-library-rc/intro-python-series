# 4.1 Making Decisions with Conditional Statements

## Questions

- How can my programs do different things based on data values?

---------------------

In this lesson, we'll learn how to write code that
runs only when certain conditions are true.

## Conditionals

We can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with an `if` statement:

<!-- ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

The following example will lead to a syntax error in the Python prompt, as it seems to expect exactly one top-level statement per invocation.
Removing `print('done')` from the example will fix the problem.

IPython executes the example from a single prompt without throwing an error.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: -->

```python
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
print('done')
```

```output
not greater
done
```

The second line of this code uses the keyword `if` to tell Python that we want to make a choice.
If the test that follows the `if` statement is true,
the body of the `if`
(i.e., the set of lines indented underneath it) is executed, and "greater" is printed.
If the test is false,
the body of the `else` is executed instead, and "not greater" is printed.
Only one or the other is ever executed before continuing on with program execution to print "done":

![A flowchart diagram of the if-else construct that tests if variable num is greater than 100](fig/4.1_python-flowchart-conditional.png)

Conditional statements don't have to include an `else`.
If there isn't one,
Python simply does nothing if the test is false:

```python
num = 53
print('before conditional...')
if num > 100:
    print(num, 'is greater than 100')
print('...after conditional')
```

```output
before conditional...
...after conditional
```

We can also chain several tests together using `elif`,
which is short for "else if".
The following Python code uses `elif` to print the sign of a number.

```python
num = -3

if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is positive')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is negative')
```

```output
-3 is negative
```

Note that to test for equality we use a double equals sign `==`
rather than a single equals sign `=` which is used to assign values.

## Comparing in Python

Along with the `>` and `==` operators we have already used for comparing values in our
conditionals, there are a few more options to know about:

- `>`: greater than
- `<`: less than
- `==`: equal to
- `!=`: does not equal
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `<=`: less than or equal to
  
-------------------

We can also combine tests using `and` and `or`.
`and` is only true if both parts are true:

```python
if (1 > 0) and (-1 >= 0):
    print('both parts are true')
else:
    print('at least one part is false')
```

```output
at least one part is false
```

while `or` is true if at least one part is true:

```python
if (1 < 0) or (1 >= 0):
    print('at least one test is true')
```

```output
at least one test is true
```

## `True` and `False`

`True` and `False` are special words in Python called `booleans`,
which represent truth values. A statement such as `1 < 0` returns
the value `False`, while `-1 < 0` returns the value `True`.

------------------

## Looking at our data

Let's return to our dataset of book searches.
We're going to focus on three files:

```output
2026-02-18_google-trends-search-1_VALUES.csv
2026-02-18_google-trends-search-2_VALUES.csv
```

Each file is for a different city, and contains a table with 
- 8 books (rows)
- 61 months (columns)

Let us load the data for the first search.
We'll use pandas this time to see how to use data that has row and column labels, including dates (the columns are months).

```python
import pandas

df = pandas.read_csv("2026-02-18_google-trends-search-1.csv", index_col=0)
print("Original data type of column labels:", df.columns.dtype)

# convert the column labels from strings like "2021-02-01" to datetimes.
months_str = list(df.columns)
months_datetime = pandas.to_datetime(months_str)
months_mapper = dict(zip(months_str, months_datetime))
df = df.rename(mapper=months_mapper, axis="columns")
print("Converted data type of column labels:",df.columns.dtype)

```

```output
Original data type of column labels: str
Converted data type of column labels: datetime64[us]
```

Say we want to find out whether the month with the most searches was either
- after 2022, or
- before or in 2022

```python
# calculate the month with the most searches, across all books.

# first, calculate the monthly sum across books
monthly_total_across_books = df.sum(axis=0)
print("Monthly total:\n", monthly_total_across_books)

# then, calculate the top month
top_month = monthly_total_across_books.idxmax()
print("Top month:", top_month)

# make a datetime variable for the end of the year 2022
end_2022 = numpy.datetime64("2022-12-31")

# evaluate whether the top month was after 2022 or in/before 2022
if top_month >= end_2022:
    print("The max number of searches occurred after 2022")
else:
    print("The max number of searches occurred in or before 2022")
```

```output
The max number of searches occurred after 2022
```

Now let's see whether search 1 and search 2 had the same top month.

```python
df1 = pandas.read_csv("2026-02-18_google-trends-search-1.csv", index_col=0)
df2 = pandas.read_csv("2026-02-18_google-trends-search-2.csv", index_col=0)

months_str = list(df.columns)
months_datetime = pandas.to_datetime(months_str)
months_mapper = dict(zip(months_str, months_datetime))
df1 = df1.rename(mapper=months_mapper, axis="columns")
df2 = df2.rename(mapper=months_mapper, axis="columns")

top_month_df1 = df1.sum(axis=0).idxmax()
top_month_df2 = df2.sum(axis=0).idxmax()

if top_month_df1 < top_month_df2:
    print("Search 1 had its top month first")
elif top_month_df2 < top_month_df1:
    print("Search 2 had its top month first")
else:
    print("Searches 1 and 2 had the same top month")
```

```output
Search 2 had its top month first
```
<!-- 
Now let's try something more complicated. Let's load the data for cities 7-9 and for each city, display which week contained their most-busy day.

One way to do this is to make a dictionary that defines which days are in which weeks, and then use conditional statements to see which range of days contains the most-busy day

```python
import glob

file_paths = sorted(glob.glob("exhibit-visits_city-*_varied-peak.csv"))

days_in_weeks = {
    "week 3": range(14, 21),
    "week 4": range(21, 28),
    "week 5": range(28, 35),
}

i_city_no = len("exhibit-visits_city-")
for file_path in file_paths:
    city_number = int(file_path[i_city_no : i_city_no + 1])
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file_path, delimiter=",")
    daily_total = numpy.sum(data, axis=0)
    most_busy_day = numpy.argmax(daily_total)

    for week_name, days_in_week in days_in_weeks.items():
        if most_busy_day in days_in_week:
            print(f"City {city_number} had their top day in {week_name}")
```

```output
City 7 had their top day in week 4
City 8 had their top day in week 5
City 9 had their top day in week 4
```

This illustrates the use of conditional statements in nested loops. But there's an easier way to accomplish this task

```python
import glob

file_paths = sorted(glob.glob("exhibit-visits_city-*_varied-peak.csv"))

i_city_no = len("exhibit-visits_city-")
for file_path in file_paths:
    city_number = int(file_path[i_city_no : i_city_no + 1])
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file_path, delimiter=",")
    daily_total = numpy.sum(data, axis=0)
    most_busy_day = numpy.argmax(daily_total)
    week_number = (most_busy_day // 7) + 1

    print(f"City {city_number} had their top day in week {week_number}")
```

```output
City 7 had their top day in week 4
City 8 had their top day in week 5
City 9 had their top day in week 4
``` -->

## Challenge: How Many Paths?

Consider this code:

```python
if 4 > 5:
    print('A')
elif 4 == 5:
    print('B')
elif 4 < 5:
    print('C')
```

Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code?
Why did you pick this answer?

1. A
2. B
3. C
4. B and C

### Solution

C gets printed because the first two conditions, `4 > 5` and `4 == 5`, are not true,
but `4 < 5` is true.
In this case only one of these conditions can be true for at a time, but in other
scenarios multiple `elif` conditions could be met. In these scenarios only the action
associated with the first true `elif` condition will occur, starting from the top of the
conditional section.

This contrasts with the case of multiple `if` statements, where every action can occur
as long as their condition is met.

![A flowchart diagram of a conditional section with multiple if statements and some possible outcomes.](fig/4.1_python-multi-if.png)

<!-- ## Challenge: What Is Truth?

`True` and `False` booleans are not the only values in Python that are true and false.
In fact, *any* value can be used in an `if` or `elif`.
After reading and running the code below,
explain what the rule is for which values are considered true and which are considered false.

```python
if '':
    print('empty string is true')
if 'word':
    print('word is true')
if []:
    print('empty list is true')
if [1, 2, 3]:
    print('non-empty list is true')
if 0:
    print('zero is true')
if 1:
    print('one is true')
``` -->
<!--
## Challenge: That's Not What I Meant
 
Sometimes it is useful to check whether some condition is not true.
The Boolean operator `not` can do this explicitly.
After reading and running the code below,
write some `if` statements that use `not` to test the rule
that you formulated in the previous challenge.

```python
if not '':
    print('empty string is not true')
if not 'word':
    print('word is not true')
if not not True:
    print('not not True is true')
``` -->

<!-- ## Challenge: Close Enough

Write some conditions that print `True` if the variable `a` is within 10% of the variable `b`
and `False` otherwise.
Compare your implementation with your partner's:
do you get the same answer for all possible pairs of numbers?

### Hint

There is a [built-in function `abs`][abs-function] that returns the absolute value of
a number:

```python
print(abs(-12))
```

```output
12
```

### Solution 1

```python
a = 5
b = 5.1

if abs(a - b) <= 0.1 * abs(b):
    print('True')
else:
    print('False')
```

### Solution 2

```python
print(abs(a - b) <= 0.1 * abs(b))
```

This works because the Booleans `True` and `False`
have string representations which can be printed. -->

## Challenge: Sorting a List Into Buckets

We'd like to break our list of files into three lists called `city_files`, `yearly_files`, and `other_files`,
respectively.

Add code to the template below to do this. Note that the string method
[`startswith`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith)
returns `True` if and only if the string it is called on starts with the string
passed as an argument, that is:

```python
'String'.startswith('Str')
```

```output
True
```

But

```python
'String'.startswith('str')
```

```output
False
```

Use the following Python code as your starting point:

```python
filenames = [
    "city-3.csv",
    "city-4.csv",
    "year-1.csv",
    "year-2.csv",
    "city-2.csv",
    "sandbox.py",
]
city_files = []
yearly_files = []
other_files = []
```

Your solution should:

1. loop over the names of the files
2. figure out which group each filename belongs in
3. append the filename to that list

In the end the three lists should be:

```output
city_files: ['city-3.csv', 'city-4.csv', 'city-2.csv']
yearly_files: ['year-1.csv', 'year-2.csv']
other_files: ['sandbox.py']
```

### Hint: fill in the blanks

```python
filenames = [
    "city-3.csv",
    "city-4.csv",
    "year-1.csv",
    "year-2.csv",
    "city-2.csv",
    "sandbox.py",
]
city_files = []
yearly_files = []
other_files = []

for filename in filenames:
    if filename.startswith("city"):
        city_files.append(filename)
    elif filename.startswith("year"):
        _____.append(filename)
    else:
        other_files._____(filename)

print("city_files:", city_files)
print("yearly_files:", _____)
_____("other_files:", _____)

```

```output
city_files: ['city-3.csv', 'city-4.csv', 'city-2.csv']
yearly_files: ['year-1.csv', 'year-2.csv']
other_files: ['sandbox.py']
```

### Solution

```python
filenames = [
    "city-3.csv",
    "city-4.csv",
    "year-1.csv",
    "year-2.csv",
    "city-2.csv",
    "sandbox.py",
]
city_files = []
yearly_files = []
other_files = []

for filename in filenames:
    if filename.startswith("city"):
        city_files.append(filename)
    elif filename.startswith("year"):
        yearly_files.append(filename)
    else:
        other_files.append(filename)

print("city_files:", city_files)
print("yearly_files:", yearly_files)
print("other_files:", other_files)
```

```output
city_files: ['city-3.csv', 'city-4.csv', 'city-2.csv']
yearly_files: ['year-1.csv', 'year-2.csv']
other_files: ['sandbox.py']
```

## Challenge: Counting Vowels

1. Write a loop that counts the number of vowels in a character string.
2. Test it on a few individual words and full sentences.
3. Once you are done, compare your solution to your neighbor's.
  Did you make the same decisions about how to handle the letter 'y'
  (which some people think is a vowel, and some do not)?

### Hint: Fill in the blanks

```python
vowels = '______'
sentence = 'Mary had a little lamb.'
count = 0
for character in sentence:
    if _____ in vowels:
        count = count + 1

print('The number of vowels in this string is ' + str(count))
```

### Solution

```python
vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
sentence = 'Mary had a little lamb.'
count = 0
for char in sentence:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1

print('The number of vowels in this string is ' + str(count))
```

## Key points

- Use `if condition` to start a conditional statement, `elif condition` to provide additional tests, and `else` to provide a default.
- The bodies of the branches of conditional statements must be indented.
- Use `==` to test for equality.
- `X and Y` is only true if both `X` and `Y` are true.
- `X or Y` is true if either `X` or `Y`, or both, are true.
- Zero, the empty string, and the empty list are considered false; all other numbers, strings, and lists are considered true.
- `True` and `False` represent truth values.
