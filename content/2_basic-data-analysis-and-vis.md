|---|---|---|
| 2.1 Environments and Libraries | virtual environments, installing libraries | How do I create a virtual environment? How do I install the Python libraries that I want to work with? |
| 2.2 Reading and Manipulating Tabular Data | libraries, paths, reading data, manipulating data, simple analysis (e.g., calculating means) | What are libraries? How do I use functions from libraries? How do I define a path to a data file relative to my code file? How can I read, manipulate, and analyze tabular data files in Python?  |
| 2.3 Visualizing Tabular Data | basic plotting, subplots, customizing plots | What are libraries?  How do I use functions from libraries?  How do I define a path to a data file relative to my code file?  How can I read, manipulate, and analyze tabular data files in Python?  |
